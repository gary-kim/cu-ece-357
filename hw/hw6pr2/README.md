# hw6pr2: Locks

~~This project must be built with `cmake` as the `CMakeLists.txt` includes various compile definitions that are required to build the correct set of files for each executable.~~

This project can be built with just the `Makefile` if desired on an x86_64 system though it is still recommended to use CMake as that will optimize the build process and also allow the build to succeed on 32-bit x86 systems.

This was done to deduplicate code.
